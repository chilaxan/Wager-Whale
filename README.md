# HackNJIT2023: Wager Whales

We wanted to build an interactive website that used aquatic live streams for betting!
It was a big challenge, with a lot of moving parts, especially in 24 hours. Theres plenty we can still work on,
but we think this is pretty good for now!

The live site can be found at [wagerwhales.club](https://wagerwhales.club)

The machine learning model requires weights, these can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1daHSBGN_o5oXcd9Jcw7dQazn1lEsKmnf/view?usp=drive_link).
Download and place in repo as `/backend/yolofish/fishyolo.weights`

In the future, we want to train a better model for detecting fish, but this was the best we could do in 24 hours. Enjoy!

#### To run the webserver, use `./run.sh <hostdomain>`
